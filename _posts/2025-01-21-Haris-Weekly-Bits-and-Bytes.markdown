currently trying to set this thing up so that people can actually save their eyes from light mode, I intend on posting once a week, with some sort of weekly meme, and/or anime hype, I'll let the anime hype thing be as is, since they ma include spoilers and I don't exactly know how to hide stuff yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out, also I could maybe add some sort of puzzle to this thing too, who knows, for now, suffer under the wrath of my light mode! >:D

P.S. theres a [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) and [chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en) extension called dark reader you can use to read in dark mode untill I figure out how to manage this

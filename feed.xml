I’m actually really excited to talk about stuff and Ive been brainstorming about this for so long, so excited in fact that…. I forgot what I wanted to talk about…</p>

<p>so, heres a ramble about gpus, games, anime, and computers</p>

<h1 id="in-a-galaxy-far-far-away">IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY</h1>

<p>yeah no nevermind, well, back to topic, gpus, see the new 5090 yet? no, not in person, we too broke for that shit, … can I say shit? I mean… theres no moderation since I actually own the site so…</p>

<p>anyways, the 5090, amazing ass specs, good stuff, blackwell architecture (I barely know von neumann architecture), honestly? before the 5090 review I didn’t even know that there were games even the 2080 struggled at, let alone performed at sub-10 fps (talking about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>) which was very suprising, since the last game I’ve played was CoD:Bo2 on the xbox360, which was back in 2017, back when I didn’t even know what fps was, on split screen</p>

<p>speaking of games:</p>

<h1 id="games">GAMES</h1>

<p>Balatro has been pretty meta lately, and I tried it (don’t tell anyone that I pirated the game okay?), which made me want to buy a deck of cards, I didn’t end up buying a deck, because I barely have enough time to binge watch anime, let alone play games, people say that its very addicting, I can’t exactly say I disagree, but I want an even more addicting game, this didn’t hit the spot for me, its been a while since I’ve been able to do nothing but think about a game that I want to play, people around me seem to be addicted to weird shooter games on their phones (I won’t be calling you out, don’t worry, I don’t want half of the population around me to target me for calling out a weird ass game)</p>

<h1 id="anime-time">ANIME TIME</h1>

<p>ever since solo levelling the anime came out, Ive been pretty excited for it, the artists really deserve alot of credit for the visuals on the anime, although I personally still prefer the manhwa</p>

<h1 id="compooter">compooter</h1>

<p>so Ive been wanting to start an 8 bit computer for a while now, and ive looked up courses and ive settled on <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> its a pretty good course and very comprehensive, really excited to run doom on my own computer, although I don’t know much about a display, but I guess I’ll figure that out with time</p>

<h1 id="notice">NOTICE</h1>

<p>I think my co-workers, and my family might be reading this, so, I can’t exactly go all out… (or maybe ? ;&gt; ) but you can pretty much expect me to be plenty unfiltered here, as of now, untill uni begins, I’ll likely keep working on this, so that this is enough for other new people to see (yes, you don’t count, you’re here for the content, not for the perks) and when I’m knee deep in studying and working all I’d have to do is to add pages here</p>

<h1 id="change-log">change log</h1>

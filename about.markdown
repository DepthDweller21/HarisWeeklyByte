This is my Personal journey in computing, programming and living life in a semi-tech world, where flying cars dont exist comercially yet, and cows can't fly, you're welcome to join my journey in learning, and living life so that we make the most of it while we're alive with fun, memes, anime, and best of all, finding out more about the freaky nature of computers.

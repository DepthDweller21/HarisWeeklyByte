# 1-Bit Computer Resources



This is a comprehensive list of resources you'll need to build a 1-bit computer on a breadboard.



## Hardware Components

1. **Breadboards**: At least one large breadboard.

2. **Jumper Wires**: For connections.

3. **Transistors**: Basic NPN or PNP (e.g., 2N2222, BC547) for logic gates.

4. **LEDs**: For output visualization.

5. **Resistors**:

   - Pull-up/pull-down resistors (1kΩ–10kΩ range).

   - Current-limiting resistors for LEDs (220Ω–330Ω).

6. **Capacitors**:

   - Small ceramic (10nF–100nF) for debouncing or filtering.

   - Electrolytic (10µF–100µF) for power stability.

7. **Tactile Switches/Push Buttons**: For input signals.

8. **Battery/Power Supply**:

   - 5V USB power supply.

   - Breadboard-compatible power module (e.g., 5V/3.3V switchable).

9. **Diodes**: Small signal diodes like 1N4148 for logic circuit protection.

10. **Logic ICs (Optional)**: If avoiding transistors, simple gates like 7400 series NAND/NOT gates.



## Tools

1. **Multimeter**: For voltage and connectivity checks.

2. **Logic Probe**: To check the state (high/low) of signals.

3. **Small Screwdriver**: For connecting power modules or tightening components.



## Basic Design Goals

1. **Registers**: Simple D flip-flop or SR latch for 1-bit storage (can be made with transistors or ICs like 7474).

2. **Clock**: Basic clock signal using a 555 timer IC or a debounced button.

3. **Input/Output**:

   - Buttons for binary input.

   - LEDs for binary output.

4. **Logic Operations**: Implement basic operations like AND, OR, NOT using transistors or logic gates.
